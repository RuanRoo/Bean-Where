                we know... we understand... we  sympathize with the problem you experience on a daily basis.
                sadly, most of humanity don't even know that this problem exists let alone provide you with the care, love
                and support you need. <br />
                <br />
                but this is why we are here. <br />
                <br />
                we at bean where understand that good coffee does not merely mean a coffee that was made by a "barista", 
                or a takeway from your local Mugg & Bean. we know that good coffee is a science, an artform, a way of life. <br />
                <br />
                to counter this oppression that is rarely talked about, we started this community where people such as yourself can
                come to find like-minded snobbs and read about best local artisans to get your daily fix. here you will find ratings and reviews 
                of the best coffee spots in cape town from real people. <br />
                <br />
                we invite you to explore the posts made by others and also post your favourites and share the love.
